# L3Cube-IndicQuest: A Benchmark Questing Answering Dataset for Evaluating Knowledge of LLMs in Indic Context

L3Cube-IndicQuest is a dataset comprising 4,000 question-answer pairs across 20 languages, including English, Assamese, Bengali, Dogri, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Konkani, Maithili, Malayalam, Marathi, Meitei (Manipuri), Nepali, Odia, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. This dataset is designed to assess the knowledge representation of these Indic Languages in multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) within the Indian context.
The dataset spans five domains: Literature, History, Geography, Politics, and Economics, with each language featuring 200 questions. The questions were originally created in English, verified for accuracy, and then translated into other languages. IndicQuest serves as a valuable benchmark for evaluating LLMs in multilingual settings. For further details, please refer to our research <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08706"> paper </a>.
